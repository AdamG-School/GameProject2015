21st Century Learning Project-Designing and Making a Video Game
Adam Giunta, Phillip Iwonow, Michael Diccachio

This project was made in an education environment by a group of students who had no teacher, and access to all the
resources available. This was done for educational purposes to learn about Video Game development, general 
software development, artistic virtual design, 3D/2D art, graphic design, team building, and teamwork.

Permission for this project was granted by the guidence department of Hopedale Highschool, MA (2015).
This work was created for educational purposes only and is not intended to be used for profit by the creators
or the school at the current time. All finantial agreements, however, are not concrete and could change during the early 
stages of this project's development. Any money that would be gathered from the project would go to the school for support
of the facility and education.
